    "# Using a pre-trained convnet\n",
    "\n",
    "A common and highly effective approach to deep learning on small image datasets is to leverage a pre-trained network. A pre-trained network \n",
    "is simply a saved network previously trained on a large dataset, typically on a large-scale image classification task. If this original \n",
    "dataset is large enough and general enough, then the spatial feature hierarchy learned by the pre-trained network can effectively act as a \n",
    "generic model of our visual world, and hence its features can prove useful for many different computer vision problems, even though these \n",
    "new problems might involve completely different classes from those of the original task. For instance, one might train a network on \n",
    "ImageNet (where classes are mostly animals and everyday objects) and then re-purpose this trained network for something as remote as \n",
    "identifying furniture items in images. Such portability of learned features across different problems is a key advantage of deep learning \n",
    "compared to many older shallow learning approaches, and it makes deep learning very effective for small-data problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will consider a large convnet trained on the ImageNet dataset (1.4 million labeled images and 1000 different classes). \n",
    "\n",
    "La idea principal es utilitzar diferents arquitectures (VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, Inception, Inception-ResNet, Xception) para despues generar un mix que nos permita obtener mejores resultados.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to leverage a pre-trained network: *feature extraction* and *fine-tuning*. Fine-tuning is much slower and more expensive, but allows \n",
    "us to leverage data augmentation during training: extending the `conv_base` model and running it end-to-end on the inputs. Note that this \n",
    "technique is in fact so expensive that you should only attempt it if you have access to a GPU: it is absolutely intractable on CPU. If you \n",
    "cannot run your code on GPU, then feature extraction is the way to go.\n",

    "fully-connected classifier) and these top layers. This is called \"fine-tuning\" because it slightly adjusts the more abstract \n",

Since the `Dense` layers on top are randomly initialized, very large weight updates would be propagated through the network, effectively destroying the representations previously learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Keras, freezing a network is done by setting its `trainable` attribute to `False`.    \n",
